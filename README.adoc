== How To Generate the Book

To generate e-book files is to do so manually with Asciidoctor. If you run the following you _may_ actually get HTML, Epub, Mobi and PDF output files:

----
$ bundle exec rake build
(in /repo/ypbook)
Converting to HTML...
 -- HTML output at book/Heading-for-the-Yocto-Project.html
Converting to EPub...
 -- Epub output at book/Heading-for-the-Yocto-Project.epub
Converting to Mobi (kf8)...
 -- Mobi output at book/Heading-for-the-Yocto-Project.mobi
Converting to PDF... (this one takes a while)
asciidoctor: WARNING: conversion missing in backend pdf for pass
 -- PDF  output at book/Heading-for-the-Yocto-Project.pdf
----

This uses the `asciidoctor`, `asciidoctor-pdf` and `asciidoctor-epub` projects.
